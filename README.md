Hello team :)

## IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR RUNNING BACKEND SERVER WITH FRONT END

In order to successfully run the program, do npm start-b and npm start-f in two separate terminals in order to start both sides of the application

This will connect the server so that actual information can be pulled and used for testing and entering purposes

You will DEFINITELY need to run npm i again in order to make sure that you have all of the packages you need in order to compile
